# React Trainer Website Clone

This is a React project for my fullstack webdev bootcamp where I was tasked with building a clone website; I chose a trainer website and implemented a React frontend with TailwindCSS styling. The project allowed me to learn and develop knowledge about React components and passing props together with using a dummy API file to map over products to render to the frontend. 


## Features
